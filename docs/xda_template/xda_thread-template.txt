[SIZE="7"][B]AICP[/B][/SIZE]
[SIZE="1"][B]Android Ice Cold Project[/B][/SIZE]

AICP is known by everyone as the "Ice Cold Project" that started on a Desire HD years ago (2012) and since then has evolved into a mature ROM with the BEST community that you can find!!!

Until Android Lollipop, the ROM has always been based on AOKP. Unfortunately, since AOKP stopped development (but made a comeback later), we changed our base to CM.
With the re-brand of CM to LineageOS (LOS), we became LineageOS based with some tweaks from AOSP and then changed to be based on the "Ground Zero Open Source Project" (GZOSP) for Android Pie.
We changed again for Android Q-R with a base of AOSP repositories and some additions from LineageOS for device-specific repositories.

If there are any bugs we will sort them out if it concerns our codebase. This ROM isn't LineageOS supported, so there is no need to report errors/bugs to them!!

[B][U][COLOR="Blue"]Please note that official builds will be deleted from our servers every month due to maintenance services.
We advise everyone to keep at least the latest or best working build on their device as a backup.
Maybe copy it to a cloud service or USB too.[/COLOR][/U][/B]

(Just click the changelog button next to the download link in the list of builds available for your device)

(link the best one for your device, there are several variants out there right now, nano/micro GApps from opengapps.org is almost always a good choice though)

You tell... :P

[B][U][COLOR="Blue"]FAQ:[/COLOR][/U][/B]
[HIDE][B]Before using the ROM:[/B]
[COLOR="Red"]Q. [I]Can I have an ETA for the next build?[/I][/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]A. Yes, just look [url="https://github.com/AICP/vendor_jenkins/blob/r11.1/aicp-build-targets"]here[/url] to see what day your device is built on.[/COLOR]

[COLOR="Red"]Q. [I] Does this ROM [B]support[/B] custom kernels officially?[/I][/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]A. No. You can still use them, but the discussion should go in the thread of the respective kernel. We don't offer support for bugs you might encounter while using them![/COLOR]

[B]Flashing the ROM:[/B]
[COLOR="Red"]Q. [I]What do I need to know before flashing?[/I][/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]A. Check the flashing instructions...[/COLOR]

[COLOR="Red"]Q. [I]Can the builds be dirty flashed over each other?[/I][/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]A. Yes, this is the usual behavior on flashing a new official build by (or using) the build-in updater service.[/COLOR]

[COLOR="Red"]Q. [I]How do I 'dirty flash' builds?[/I][/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]A. Wipe the System, Cache, and ART/Dalvik cache. Flash the ROM, GApps (only needed if you wipe the system), your preferred root solution, and reboot. Or just use the OTA app to perform that task for you.[/COLOR]

[COLOR="Red"]Q. [I]How do I flash kernel builds?[/I][/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]A1. If it's a .img file, boot into TWRP and go to the install page in TWRP, in the bottom right corner select "install image", select the desired kernel, then select "boot" as the destination, then swipe to flash, then go back to the install screen and install your root method again, if you don't want to lose root and reboot.[/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]A2. If it's a flashable ZIP, you can flash it together with a ROM update or separately. Go to the install page in TWRP, choose the kernel zip (or add it to the flash queue right after the ROM zip). Then add your root method to the queue if you don't want to lose root. Now swipe to flash and reboot afterward.[/COLOR]

[B]Using the ROM:[/B]

[COLOR="Red"]Q. [I]Do I need to provide a logcat if I'm reporting a bug?[/I][/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]A. If you want it to be fixed faster (or at all) then yes, you should definitely provide a logcat AND the model name. (Note: Please just link the logcat from your GDrive, Dropbox, etc. Do not post the content here. Thanks.)[/COLOR]

[COLOR="Red"]Q. [I]How do I get a logcat, what type should I get, and more questions that can conveniently be answered by my pre-determined answer?[/I][/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]A1. Read [URL="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hj289Mv_13uHyW7ZSp0nId37Up3NBBrrScKRMqUaCII/edit"]this[/URL] thoroughly. Also, here's a good app for getting logs: [url]https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tortel.syslog[/url] (Root needed).[/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]A2. If you are already rooted, you can use the built-in feature to make a logcat and provide that. Just look into the others section on the AICP Extras main page.[/COLOR][/HIDE]

[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AICP/vendor_aicp/r11.1/docs/xda_template/instructions.png[/IMG]

The ROM should contain everything you need to enjoy Android R. You don't need to install any Add-ons, simply download the latest ROM and GApps, then follow the flashing instructions and go!
If you want the device to run the ROM "rooted", you can flash a root solution of your choice after the ROM zip file.

It is STRONGLY recommended to fully wipe your device before flashing and please avoid restoring system apps and system data with Titanium Backup (or with any backup/restore app) as this can cause stability issues that are very hard to debug, restoring regular apps is fine though.
If you believe you know what you're doing - then fine, go ahead, but please don't complain if you experience any strange behavior.

[SIZE=3]How to flash for the first time:[/SIZE]
(Again: Don't do it if you don't know!)

1. Download the ROM and GApps and transfer them to your device.
2. Boot to recovery (TWRP recommended).
3. Wipe the System, Cache, and Data (you might need to format the data partition!).
4. Flash the ROM zip file.
5. Flash the GApps (optional, needed for e.g. Google Playstore to work), GApps are already included for some a/b devices.
6. Reboot and set up your device, enable developer settings and in them, OEM unlock/Advanced reboot/USB tethering.
7. Reboot back into TWRP recovery.
8. Flash the root solution of your choice (optional).
9. Reboot your device.
[B][I]The procedure may vary from device to device and is a bit different on system updates![/I][/B]


[B]The ROM has GApps persistence in between dirty flashes, so you only have to flash them once! This might differ on AvB Devices.[/B]


[SIZE=3][B]Currently supported Root Solution:[/B][/SIZE]

[COLOR="DarkRed"][URL="https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445"]Magisk stable[/URL][/COLOR]
Magisk versions >= 20.3 don't usually need to be flashed on every dirty flash.
Depending on the device, you may need to flash it every time, unless your maintainer says otherwise, you should be fine.

[U][B]PREREQUISITE FOR OTA ("Over-The-Air" Updates):[/B][/U]
TWRP recovery is needed to be able to flash using the built-in OTA app.
Please make sure that you are on the latest TWRP recovery, keep in mind that this could also be an unofficial version!
On encrypted devices, you will have to enter your PIN/password in TWRP before the process starts.
